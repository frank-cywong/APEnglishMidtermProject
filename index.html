				In <i>Exit West</i>, Saeed and Nadia get a chance at a better life and a chance to escape the warzone their city turned into through magical portals.
				These magical portals randomly pop up in hidden places, and transport anyone who goes through them between two locations on Earth instantaneously.
				The fact that these portals are everywhere but also relatively hidden is what puts them out of reach of the authorities, provides an accessible pathway between impoverished and wealthy countries, or in Sayeed and Nadia's case, from their war-torn city to a beach resort in Greece.
				<br><br>
				These portals don't exist in the real world, but nowadays, we have the next best thing: Air travel.

							One can travel from Kabul, Afghanistan to London; Mogadishu, Somalia to New York; Caracas, Venezuela to Paris; or Tripoli, Libya to Toronto in comfort and safely with just one easily-bookable plane ticket for anywhere from $400 to $1000.
							<br><br>
							Compared to paying a smuggler roughly $1500 to cross deserts and mountains from Afghanistan to Istanbul, or up to $7000 to $10000 to bring you through harsh terrain, crossing the jungle that is the Darién Gap, from Venezuela to the US, all while constantly under the threat of being arrested and deported by authorities, robbed or murdered by criminals, or dying from a multitude of potential causes, these plane tickets sound like a much better deal.
							<br><br>
							This might make you wonder: Why don't migrants just fly?<br>
							The answer to that question is simple:<br>
							<b>They can't. We don't let them.</b>

				What do I mean when I say we don't let them?<br>
				In order to travel to another country, you need a visa, or a passport that offers visa-free access (or visa-on-arrival) to that country.<br>
				For people holding United States passports or passports from developed countries / regions in general, this isn't a big issue. The United States passport gives visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 186/227 countries and territories around the world, with notable exceptions including China and Russia (visa-required in advance) and India (e-visa required).
				<br>
				For Japanese citizens, they have the most powerful passport in the world, being able to visit 193/227 countries and regions around the world visa-free.
				<br>
				On the other hand, you have Afghani citizens, who require a visa for basically every country in the world, only being able to visit 27/227 countries and regions around the world without a visa in advance, most of which are island nations or African countries (the geographically closest one to the United States being Haiti, a country whose own citizens are already fleeing it) that have a visa-on-arrival (or visa-free) policy for nearly all nationalities.
				And this assumes that someone who wants to leave Afghanistan can get a passport to begin with, as well as transit visas that are needed to connect through most major European and North American airports.
				Even if they overcome all of these hurdles and finally arrive at their destination, somehow don't get deported or denied entry, then they're now in a most likely poor or tiny country without resettlement aid or opportunities.
				<br>
				This trend holds more generally, with developed countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, or the Schengen Area (EU) all restricting visa-free entry to those from other developed countries.
				<br>
				Even more broadly, graphing the number of countries a country's citizens can access without having to apply for a visa in advance over its Human Development Index, we see a strong correlation (R² = 0.64).

				However it wasn’t always this way. If you go back 100-200 years, countries did not exert as much control over their borders.<br>
				The United States has been a nation of immigrants from its inception, yet it was one of the first to adopt modern restrictive immigration policies that targeted people from undesireable countries.<br>
				In 1875, the Page Act prohibited immigration of "unfree laborers" and women brought for "immoral purposes", which was enforced and interpreted to mainly refer to Chinese and other East Asian women, effectively banning them from moving to the United States.<br>
				This ended 99 years of (relatively) unrestricted immigration since the signing of the Declaration of Independence, and the 268 years of unrestricted immigration if you count from the formation of the Jamestown colony.<br>
				Yet even then, one didn't need a visa to travel to the United States. The main difficulty however was obtaining a passport, as at the time, in general, "states were generally more preoccupied with preventing exit rather than controlling immigration" (Czaika), while "emerging mercantilist states in northern Europe saw the population as a valuable economic resource and as potential recruits for the military" (Czaika).<br>
				This changed with World War I, with the increasing amount of refugees meant that countries wanted to prevent undesireable people from even trying to seek entry to their country, instead wanting to be able to deny those undesireables in advance. Therefore, countries starting implementing visas, instead of having an immigration officer process immigrants on arrival (for example at Ellis Island, which also showed the inequality at the time as first and second class passengers were assumed to be affluent and could bypass normal checks, while third class passengers were subject to much more detailed inspection), they would be processed in advance through counsulates and embassies overseas.
			</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
				<td>
					In 1924, the United States passed the Immigration Act of 1924, which required all arriving non-citizens to have visas, marking the end of any sort of idea of unrestricted immigration, even for those from Europe, as they would still have to apply for a visa in advance.<br>
					An early case of visas being used to prevent refugee arrival would be that of the <i>St. Louis</i>, which sailed from Hamburg, Germany to Havana, Cuba in 1939 carrying mostly Jews fleeing the Holocaust. They had valid Cuban transit visas, and most had pending US visas, however a change in Cuban policy meant that recently issued visas were cancelled. Except for a few non-Jews and a few Jews who had valid US visas, the rest were sent back to Europe after the US denied them entry as well. 620 of them were sent to Continental Europe, and 254 would later die in the Holocaust.<br>

				Let's fast forward 40-50 years. We started the replacement our old semi-portals that were ocean liners with widespread air travel. At the same time, decolonization kicked in.<br>
				In Europe, countries were tightening their immigration policies to restrict immigration from their current or former colonies to their mother country. However, they still allowed the entry of skilled workers.<br>
				The United Kingdom passed The Commonwealth Immigration Act of 1962, The Commonwealth Immigration Act of 1968, and The Immigration Act of 1971, which by the end, restricted immigration from the UK's former colonies only to those who had ties to the UK, or those who held a work permit.<br>
				Similarly, France passed various laws in between 1974 and 1984 restricting immigration from its former colonies to skilled workers only.
				<br>
				In 1965, the United States passed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, opening up its immigration policy to allow skilled workers and family-based immigration irrespective of national origin by repealing quotas that were previously in effect by country.<br>
				By this point, most developed countries had settled on a policy of generally allowing skilled workers and those with family to immigrate, while keeping everyone else out, with the main exception being for refugees.<br>
			</p>	
			<table>
				<tr>
				<td>
					Before we move on though, I'll quickly mention one major exception to this general rule, and that is the United States' Diversity Immigrant Visa program.<br>
					The United States, every year, gives out 55000 green cards (conferring permanent residency rights) to applicants (who must have completed high school) and their families from locations with historically low levels of immigration.<br>
					How are the 55000 chosen? <b>By lottery.</b><br>
					While the program certainly isn't perfect, as like an actual lottery, only a few lucky people and their families can win, and most lose, which has also led to allegations of fraud as well as agencies that scam prospective lottery entrants, this is a unique way the United States allows those with an education to move from poverty-stricken nations or countries lacking opportunity in general to the United States, and to have a chance at achieving their own American Dream. Despite the low odds, the unique opportunity this presents to many should be recognized, especially given that the United States is the only country in the world to give out residency rights by lottery in such a manner.

				This idea of allowing in skilled workers and those with family ties and keeping out everyone else is only possible because of <b>control</b>, and this attempt at control is something that's seen in <i>Exit West</i> as well.
				Even in <i>Exit West</i>, governments try to stop the migration. The war-torn country and the insurgents Saeed and Nadia are fleeing bans looking for the portals or using them, as they don't want everyone to flee. On the other hand, in Greece and London, the government tries to control migration as much as they can. While they can't repatriate everyone or deport this many people, they can stop them from escaping, so that's what they do.
				In Greece, the portals to developed countries like the UK are heavily guarded, while those to poor or war-torn countries aren't. In London, the migrants are controlled by restricting them into a certain district of London, and then later on cutting their electricity and cell service. Even after that, they are constrained in work camps until they've worked and waited enough to qualify for an apartment, while they have to pay additional taxes as compensation to cover their "cost on society" to existing residents.
				Saeed and Nadia fled the control of the insurgency, only to end up in a different sort of control, and that's one of the reasons they decide to go through another portal, give up their slot on the housing waitlist, and go to the (relatively uncontrolled) area of the Bay Area in the US.
			</p>

					These control measures may seem extreme, but these are in reality, happening right now, even in the "western" world. Australia since 2012 has sent asylum seekers for "offshore processing" in Nauru, where they are kept locked up in a refugee camp to the point where some have gone insane, and are suffering from extremely poor living conditions. In fact, it may even be considered worse, since although these asylum seekers don't have to work, they don't get a chance to come to Australia, instead, they either remain on Nauru, or, if they're lucky and after a long time, get resettled to a third country like the US or New Zealand.
					<br><br>
					In general, countries in the real world have much more significant control than they do in <i>Exit West</i>, mainly due to their ability to control who gets to use the "portals", or in this case, aircraft.<br>
					Countries nowadays require airlines to check travel documents of travellers, and if they let someone without adequate documentation on board? They get fined, an average of $3500 per passenger, as well as having to pay for the repatriation of the passenger.<br>
					Therefore, airlines nowadays have become the most zealous enforcers of immigration law, with sometimes entry requirements on paper that are rarely checked (eg. passport validity requirements for some countries) being enforced almost exclusively by airlines out of fear of being fined.<br><br>

				This also helps countries stop refugee arrivals, as <b>if refugees can't make it to a port of entry because airlines deny boarding to them, then the refugees never get a chance to file applications for asylum.</b><br>
				And this last point is the main difference between the world of <i>Exit West</i> and the real world. In <i>Exit West</i>, refugees and migrants can go anywhere in the world, and then its the country's responsibility to deal with them, while in the real world, countries can hide away their problems provided that asylum seekers and migrants don't make it to that country's borders to actually claim asylum.<br>
				This is why many asylum seekers travel across land, crossing harsh terrain and facing danger by criminals and natural hazards to physically cross into a developed country, because at that point, they have the right to file an asylum claim which must be heard.<br>
				This is quite important and deserves repeating. In general, for most developed countries, from the US to Canada to the UK, unless you have a referral from the UNHCR or a humanitarian agency, or benefit from special programs (eg. the evacuation and resettlement of 76000 Afghanis who helped the US shortly after the Fall of Kabul), <b>you cannot apply for asylum or refugee status by yourself unless you are physically at a port of entry</b>, at which point you are usually able to apply for asylum.<br>
				And that's why the US uses Title 42 to send migrants to wait in Mexico, why Spain secures its two African exclaves in Morroco so heavily with barbed wire, why Australia sends migrants offshore to Nauru for processing, since then, they're out of sight, out of mind for the most part.<br>
				Even if the refugees have pending asylum claims, if they aren't in your country, they can be ignored for the most part until after your bureaucracy decides their case has merit and you decide to let them in.<br>
				Getting to deal with refugees (and also migrants in general) on their own terms and only accepting refugees and migrants after processing them off of their soil is the <b>control</b> that countries desire and have desired since countries started requiring visas, and is the <b>control</b> they don't have in <i>Exit West</i>.
